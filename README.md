<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The user case story is as follow:
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

Accpetance Criteria are as follows:
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
## Acknowledgments

* Study session with Sophia Tejada played a major part in the overall structure of the JS, identifying how to run a function to setup the preferences and then access them globally to be pulled into the generate password function. 
* ChatGPT alerted me to the while loop being the best solution in order to validate the length and typeOf for the passLength variable.  This allowed me to create errors with user prompts clearly stated the requirements. This also allowed me to do this in a way that is infinitely repeatable until a valid prompt is entered.
* Study session with classmates Chan Nguyen, Vanna Luciano, and Kyle Oros helped me see several different approachs to solving this prompt, and informed my math function to create a randomly generated data set from the available charset.
